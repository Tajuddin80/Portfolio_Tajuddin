            My <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]">programming journey</span> began during my college days when I tried to customize a simple HTML page for a project. That curiosity led me to explore the <span className="font-semibold">C language</span> — and I was instantly hooked! Motivated by this passion, I decided to pursue my dreams and began my <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]">B.Sc in Computer Science & Engineering at Green University of Bangladesh</span>, where I am currently in my <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]">final year</span>. My ultimate goal is to become a <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]">Software Engineer</span> and contribute to innovative solutions that make a positive impact.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Throughout this journey, I have immersed myself not only in technologies like <span className="font-semibold">JavaScript</span>, <span className="font-semibold">React</span>, <span className="font-semibold">Node.js</span>, and <span className="font-semibold">MongoDB</span>, but also developed a strong foundation in 
            <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]"> Structured Programming</span>,
            <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]"> Data Structure</span>,
            <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]"> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</span>,
            <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]"> Algorithm</span>,

            <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]"> Computer Networking</span>,
            <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]"> Artificial Intelligence</span>, 
            <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]"> Cyber Security</span>, and 
            <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]"> Machine Learning</span>.
          </p>

            I thrive on creating <span className="font-semibold text-[#B63AFF]">modern, responsive, and efficient web applications</span>. Bringing ideas to life through clean code and thoughtful design is what excites me most. I love collaborating on projects that challenge my skills and help me grow as a developer.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Beyond coding, I’m passionate about <span className="font-semibold">playing badminton</span> — it keeps me active and sharp. I also enjoy <span className="font-semibold">traveling and exploring new places</span>, which inspires fresh ideas and perspectives in both life and work.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I’m always eager to learn new technologies, experiment with creative solutions, and contribute to meaningful projects. Let’s build something awesome together!
